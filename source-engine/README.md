# Source-Engine

The Source Dedicated Server or SRCDS is a tool that runs the server component of a Source game without the client component. In other words, it simulates the game without drawing it.

This also covers games that are installed using the steamcmd utility.

### Server Ports
Many of these servers will require the steam query ports to be open for the server.
The default steam query port is 27015

Please note the server may not show up on steam game server lists due to this requirement if all ports are not set/added.

## Counter Strike: Global Offensive

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS: GO) expands upon the team-based action gameplay that it pioneered when it was launched 19 years ago. CS: GO features new maps, characters, weapons, and game modes, and delivers updated versions of the classic CS content (de_dust2, etc.).
